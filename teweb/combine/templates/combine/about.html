                <h3>Privacy notice</h3>
                <h4>Does this service store your SBML model or file?</h4>
                <p>
                    This service is implemented as a server-side facility, meaning that the computations are physically
                    performed
                    on our computers, which are housed at the Humboldt University. As a consequence, your Combine
                    Archive file
                    must be transmitted to, and stored temporarily on, our servers in order to process it.

                    In the event that this service itself exhibits an error, the Tellurium Web Team may need to inspect
                    the
                    material
                    you submitted (i.e., the Combine Archive file) to ascertain the cause of the error.

                    Your Combine Archive file will never be passed willingly to any third party, and it will be deleted
                    after
                    a period of time. Your Combine Archive file will only be used for the purposes of validating it,
                    for gathering general statistics about the uses of this service and Combine Archives and SED-ML in
                    general,
                    and for debugging the service itself (and then, only if necessary).

                    By submitting content to this service, you grant the Tellurium Web Team the right to use and store
                    your
                    file temporarily for these purposes.</p>
