        <h3>Privacy notice</h3>
        <h4>Does this service store your SBML model or file?</h4>
        <p>
            This service is implemented as a server-side facility, meaning that the computations are physically
            performed
            on our computers, which are housed at the Humboldt University. As a consequence, your Combine
            Archive file
            must be transmitted to, and stored temporarily on, our servers in order to process it.

            In the event that this service itself exhibits an error, the Tellurium Web Team may need to inspect
            the
            material
            you submitted (i.e., the Combine Archive file) to ascertain the cause of the error.

            Your Combine Archive file will never be passed willingly to any third party, and it will be deleted
            after
            a period of time. Your Combine Archive file will only be used for the purposes of validating it,
            for gathering general statistics about the uses of this service and Combine Archives and SED-ML in
            general,
            and for debugging the service itself (and then, only if necessary).

            By submitting content to this service, you grant the Tellurium Web Team the right to use and store
            your
            file temporarily for these purposes.</p>
